    "Because a majority of the students attending the University of Maryland are present on campus from September to May, the drop in number of arrests over the summer in this plot is unsuprising. What is interesting to note; however, is that the highest number of arrests occur in September. This could be due to the increased number of parties off-campus during syllabus week and the start of football tailgating season."
